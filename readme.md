## Game Instructions

 'Shooty Spaceballs' is essentially a twist on the traditional Whack-a-Mole game.
 Instead of moles you must click on as many of the vibrating yellow spaceballs (planets, asteroids, who knows..) in
 a 15 second period. Your opponent must then try to better that score.

 * Game instructions are available at the click of the 'How to Play' button on the left.

 * A difficulty level can also be set with a click of a button.

 * The game begins when the start button is pressed. This triggers the countdown and the board to go live.

 * The red balls will highlight yellow and 'vibrate' at random intervals, determined by the difficulty level selected using the buttons on the left of the screen.

 * Once player one has completed their game their score is displayed and player two's game begins. Once this is complete a screen displays the winner.

### Challenges and Problems

* Certain problems, such as making it two player and getting the timers to work correctly seem to take forever, but once I'd worked them out they seemed very logical. I realised that sometimes taking a step back from a problem and coming back to it is often more productive than staring at the screen for 6 hours straight!

* Planning out the logic took a couple of days. After struggling for the first 24 hours it became much clearer and everything flowed from then on. With more concise planning and a more focused approach - as well as allowing sufficient time for styling - my next project will flow even better.

### Wins

* It **vastly** improved my understanding of the entire process and my JavaScript and styling particularly took a massive leap. It helped me realise how much I'd learnt.

* I managed to mix a bit of everything into it, to help consolidate my learning so far - hence I used jQuery, a Bulma framework, SASS, CSS animation and HTML Audio.

* Once I had decided on the space theme and added a background image, futuristic font and couple of sfx it lifted the gameplay.

### Future Features

* I would have liked to have made it responsive and also ensure the reset button reset without refreshing.
